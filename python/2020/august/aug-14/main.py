# * [Hard] -- TwoSigma

# * A knight is placed on a given square on an 8 x 8 chessboard.
# * It is then moved randomly several times, where each move is
# * a standard knight move. If the knight jumps off the board
# * at any point, however, it is not allowed to jump back on.

# * After k moves, what is the probability that the knight remains on the board?
