// * In Ancient Greece, it was common to write text with the first line going left to right,
// * the second line going right to left, and continuing to go back and forth. This style was called "boustrophedon".

// ! Given a binary tree, write an algorithm to print the nodes in boustrophedon order.

// use binary_tree::BinaryTree;

fn main() {
    println!("Binary Tree in boustrophedon order");
    // let tree = BinaryTree {};
}
