Scan is adding to samples, test request listbox can fetch data from test requests but is using
existing just all samples not fetching by sample.

should the api to fetch test requests for a given sample use the existing test request controller
using new tab id 10 or create new controller seperately for this one?

How exactly should the bag functionality work and have you heard anything from kanika?

sample submitted (list of samples, list of tr) to mark delivered

one test request and bag and bin per transaction right now
