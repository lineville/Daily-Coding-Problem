// * [Easy] -- Square

// * The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm used to generate all prime numbers smaller
// * than N. The method is to take increasingly larger prime numbers, and mark their
// * multiples as composite.

// ! Ex: to find all primes less than 100, we would first mark [4, 6, 8, ...]
// ! (multiples of two), then [6, 9, 12, ...] (multiples of three), and so on.
// ! Once we have done this for all primes less than N, the unmarked numbers that remain will be prime.

// * Implement this algorithm.

// * Bonus: Create a generator that produces primes indefinitely (that is, without taking N as an input).
