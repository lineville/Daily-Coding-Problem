// * [Hard] -- unknown

// * Find an efficient algorithm to find the smallest distance
// * (measured in number of words) between any two given words in a string.

// ! Ex: word1: "hello", word2: "world", sentence: "dog cat hello cat dog dog hello cat world" => 1

export const wordDistance = (
  word1: string,
  word2: string,
  sentence: string
): number => {
  return 0;
};
